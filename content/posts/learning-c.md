I've decided to start learning C. I've always worked with higher-level languages that have abstracted away certain concepts like pointers and garbage collection. 
I will start this by reading and completing the exercises in [Effective C](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Introduction-Professional-Robert-Seacord/dp/1718501048) by Robert C. Seacord. The reviews describe this as a modern K&R, often held up as the standard of programming books.

I'll make a post at least every few chapters to share my progress.
