I'm inspired to try my hand at blogging. I've recently renewed my efforts to learn reverse engineering. I'll use this platform to help organize my thoughts, hold myself accountable, and maybe even solicit feedback from my dear readers.

**What am I hoping to accomplish?**
- Better understand how the software I write works.
- Build more compelling mods for some of my favorite games.
- Solve crackmes/CTFs.
- Learn something new and have some fun.

As a next step, I'll build a study plan for myself. Through some digging and recommendations, I've built up a decent collection of resources. But... that's for another post.
