I&amp;rsquo;ve recently renewed my efforts to learn reverse engineering. I&amp;rsquo;ll use this platform to help organize my thoughts, hold myself accountable, and maybe even solicit feedback from my dear readers.
What am I hoping to accomplish?
Better understand how the software I write works. Build more compelling mods for some of my favorite games. Solve crackmes/CTFs. Learn something new and have some fun.</description></item></channel></rss>
